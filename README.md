# ElanConversion
## Overview
This R package aims to provide a seamless way to convert ELAN (.eaf) files, used for linguistic annotation, into a tab-delimited text format. The package will allow users to easily process XML-based annotations from ELAN files and export them in a format similar to the native export functionality of ELAN software.
