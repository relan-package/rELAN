\title{Calculate Duration Based on Time Slot References}
\usage{
calculate_duration(time_slot_ref1, time_slot_ref2, time_slot_to_value)
}
\arguments{
\item{time_slot_ref1}{The reference ID for the first time slot.}

\item{time_slot_ref2}{The reference ID for the second time slot.}

\item{time_slot_to_value}{A named vector mapping time slot IDs to their time values.}
}
\value{
The absolute duration calculated as the difference between the time values of
the second and first time slots. Returns NA if either time slot reference does not
have an associated time value.
}
\description{
Calculates the absolute duration between two time slot references
by looking up their corresponding time values and subtracting them.
This ensures the duration is always positive, even if the time slots
are not in chronological order.
